# Persistent Data Implementation In Unity

Realized one day that I hadn't worked on a save/load system in quite some time. I originally wasn't sure about creating my own solution, or looking into resources. Ultimately I came across a very detailed series by Trevor Mock. It was through this awesome series that I created a very scalable save/load system.

## Information

This project is based upon the series by Trever Mock
